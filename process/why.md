# Why?

## v1 -- Friday, 25 August 2023

- This is a continuation of the *v r* series, which is to say it's fundamentally about *looking at Unity* (as a stand-in for 3D game production in general) and the technologies it provides.
- I really enjoy the essay/book *In Praise of Shadows*, particularly the first part, and most memorably the evocative language around the gleam of lacquer on a cup in an alcove in a dim room - the idea of light and shadow being highly evocative.
- I want a project I can chip away at.
- Looking at shadows is a way of looking at light.
- Like many parts of the videogame visual assemblage, shadows don't necessarily get looked at for their own sake very much - either as painterly substance or as technical achievement - so drawing attention to them is worthwhile.
- Shadows have a strong but also dissociated relationship with the light and object that casts them, they're sort of "this, but not" in a way that's intriguing to look at.
