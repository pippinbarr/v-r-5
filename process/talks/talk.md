## Introduction

![Pippin on Google Street View](https://pippinbarr.com/about/me/images/pippin-on-google-street-view.png)

Hi, I'm [Pippin Barr](https://pippinbarr.com), an experimental game designer and a professor of Computation Arts at Concordia University.

I'm part of the [Games as Research](https://gamesasresearch.com) project to figure out how to document the game design process.

So I'm going to talk about the [Method for Design Materialization (MDM)](https://direct.mit.edu/desi/article-abstract/39/1/55/114217/Generative-Logics-and-Conceptual-Clicks-A-Case?redirectedFrom=fulltext), which is our current best idea.

And I'll use my newest game [*v r 5*](https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-5/info) to show you how it all works.

## In Praise of Shadows

### The book

*v r 5* was inspired by the book [In Praise of Shadows by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Praise_of_Shadows). Especially Tanizaki's writing about [the nuances and categories of shadows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Praise_of_Shadows?useskin=vector#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20contrasting%20light%20and%20dark%2C%20Tanizaki%20further%20considers%20the%20layered%20tones%20of%20various%20kinds%20of%20shadows%20and%20their%20power%20to%20reflect%20low%20sheen%20materials%20like%20gold%20embroidery%2C%20patina%20and%20cloudy%20crystals.%20In%20addition%2C%20he%20distinguishes%20between%20the%20values%20of%20gleam%20and%20shine.).

> Artisans of old, when they finished their works in lacquer and decorated them in sparkling patterns, must surely have had in mind dark rooms and sought to turn to good effect what feeble light there was. Their extravagant use of gold, too, I should imagine, came of understanding how it gleams forth from out of the darkness and reflects the lamplight.

### The *v r* series

The *v r* series in general is part of my (long) history of making work that surfaces the technical underpinnings of games, such as

- [*v r 1*](https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-1/info/) (about architecture),
- [*v r 2*](https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-2/info/) (about Unity Game Objects),
- [*v r 3*](https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-3/info/) (about water), and
- [*v r $4.99*](https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-4-99/info/) (about the Asset Store).

### The next one

And so I continued with a plan to examine [*shadows* in the Unity game engine](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Shadows.html), and to make them available for contemplation.

### *v r 5*

Long story short, [I finished it](https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-5/info).

But I'm not here to make the long story short, so...

## Reflections

[![A map UI element accidentally reflected in the water](https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-5/process/images/2024-03-20-ui-reflection.png)](https://github.com/pippinbarr/v-r-5/tree/main/process/images/2024-03-20-ui-reflection.png)

### The Reflective Practitioner

Within MDM we draw heavily on the work of [Donald Schön](https://hci.stanford.edu/publications/bds/9-schon.html) and his understanding of design as a *reflective conversation with materials*.

> As you work a problem, you are continually in the process of developing a path into it, forming new appreciations and understandings as you make new moves.
>

### Documenting reflective practice

Ideally or often, a documented game would have a [public facing website](https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-5/info) that can provide layers of understanding of the project.

At the heart of the MDM is having a [process documentation component](https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-5/info/#:~:text=Documentation,the%20Code%20Repository) that you maintain during the life of the project and that is publicly visible.

We've come up with a few standard forms of documentation that we all try to adhere to as much as we can.

#### Why?s

The point of this - the idea of continually pushing yourself to have a high level understanding of the meaning of your work (research-creation specific)

Also just that idea of *reminding yourself* that you have a core idea as well - because sometimes you're in the midst of a project and you just cannot remember what the fuck you are doing

Show them, show that they are in a chronology

#### Journal

Something I've been doing for a long time in different forms

- Links
- to
- old
- docs

A general sweep through the v r 5 journal ?

Show some examples,

- a history of work,
- the potential for multi-media,
- Life stuff
- the role of emotion,
- the swearing, the goings-wrong (crucial)

(Realistically just kind of one example of each of these ideas I suppose?)

Again making sure that these lead us to commits/prototypes that are then reflective in some way of that moment in design history. Which is always, but bonus points if it really lands...

This is great because anyone can do it, with or without version control

#### ✨ Commits ✨

This is a potential big moment if we reveal *here specifically* that this is the kind of engine of amazement of MDM in general? The other stuff *could* be done just as you go along... and that feeds well into the next segment... I think that works pretty well. In which case I should probably *not* explain version control until here, or not deeply

This is the moment where we understand version control at least a little bit. (It could be semi-hilarious to make a change to the talk and show its representation in the history of the project at some point... probably at the end though)

But also to show

- Technical practice, conversation with materials
- Design taking place at the very lowest levels, decisions being made, attempts being made, design space being explored in a not-totally-linear way
- Emotion is probably in here too
- And maybe other stuff (the smart thing is to identify *n* commits that show off different ideas, but that also lead us to specific prototypes worth seeing)

Showing the association between the specific commit and ALL the files involved, not just about it being a diary (though even that is a really important thing, a diary provoked by your process)

Show the VS Code interface somewhere in here - I can edit the talk and show it showing up...?

## Prototypes

(At the heart of game design is *prototyping*, and version control allows us to see them all.)

And so this is where we need to

- Create branches to commits that allow me to show different webgl builds (or in engine, but I feel like that's trouble, so I just might want to be selective about the commits, pre-plan them)
- Show the game in engine at the end but also at some other stage of production - that difference between seeing the game as a player and being able to see it, quite literally, from the positionality of the designer... (is there some really fucking weird sense in which you can become a closer and closer version of the designer themselves? Body Snatcher?)

This bit should be kind of fun as well because I think the idea would be to return to moments I spoke about in the journal/why/commits section and show how we can see and be the design at that moment in time... unimaginably powerful...

This is the part where the game itself is back to life

## and Other Traces

This is where we're going to profile

- Other data like to-dos, curation/specialized documents, code,
- Canned Meta-data like GitHub visualizations:
  - <https://github.com/pippinbarr/v-r-5/pulse>
  - Can go through them but I think the must "interesting" thing here is how inferior they are to Ponte
- Ponte, the idea of time-as-life, rhythms, funny beats and breaks, ...
- This talk is [in the project repository as well](https://github.com/pippinbarr/v-r-5/blob/main/process/talks/talk.md)! It has its own [commit history](https://github.com/pippinbarr/v-r-5/commits/main/process/talks/talk.md)!

## of Design

- And so the point being that we have all these lenses on design we didn't have (or didn't easily have) before
- Becoming the designer
- Life and emotion
- Time-sliced
- Conversation with materials (at least for me)
- How design "really happens," rather than the idealized view of design documents and final releases - the demonolithing of design, and also the deInstagramming of process

- The idea of the closing statement
- The idea of the talk that is built within the method that helps you to reflect on what it all means
