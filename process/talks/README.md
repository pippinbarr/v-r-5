# Talk(s)

I'm going to be speaking about *v r 5* and MDM (or maybe it's the other way around) at the University of Utah and Texas A&M across the weeks of 15 April and 22 April.

- Here is the [talk](./talk.md) document (a markdown document I'll use as my home base when presenting)
- Here is where the [talk planning document](./v-r-5-talk-planning.md) where I've been thinking through what I want to say and how to say it
- Here is the (no-longer-active) [keynote presentation](./in-praise-of-shadows.key) I was going to use before I got radical and decided to present from documents and links and VS Code and Unity
