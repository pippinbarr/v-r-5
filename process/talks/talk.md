## Introduction

![Pippin on Google Street View](https://pippinbarr.com/about/me/images/pippin-on-google-street-view.png)

Hi, I'm [Pippin Barr](https://pippinbarr.com), an experimental game designer and a professor of Computation Arts at Concordia University.

I'm part of the [Games as Research](https://gamesasresearch.com) project to figure out how to document the game design process.

So I'm going to talk about the [Method for Design Materialization (MDM)](https://direct.mit.edu/desi/article-abstract/39/1/55/114217/Generative-Logics-and-Conceptual-Clicks-A-Case?redirectedFrom=fulltext), which is our current best idea.

And I'll use my newest game [*v r 5*](https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-5/info) to show you how it all works.

## In Praise of Shadows

[![The area light room interior](https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-5/press/images/area-light-interior.png)](https://github.com/pippinbarr/v-r-5/tree/main/press/images/area-light-interior.png)

*v r 5* was inspired by the book [In Praise of Shadows by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Praise_of_Shadows). Especially Tanizaki's writing about [the nuances and categories of shadows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Praise_of_Shadows?useskin=vector#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20contrasting%20light%20and%20dark%2C%20Tanizaki%20further%20considers%20the%20layered%20tones%20of%20various%20kinds%20of%20shadows%20and%20their%20power%20to%20reflect%20low%20sheen%20materials%20like%20gold%20embroidery%2C%20patina%20and%20cloudy%20crystals.%20In%20addition%2C%20he%20distinguishes%20between%20the%20values%20of%20gleam%20and%20shine.).

The *v r* series in general is part of my (long) history of making work that surfaces the technical underpinnings of games, such as [*v r 1*](https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-1/info/) (about architecture), [*v r 2*](https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-2/info/) (about Unity Game Objects), [*v r 3*](https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-3/info/) (about water), and [*v r $4.99*(https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-4-99/info/)] (about the Asset Store).

And so I continued with a plan to examine [*shadows* in the Unity game engine](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Shadows.html), and to make them available for contemplation.

## Reflections

### The Reflective Practitioner

Within MDM we draw heavily on the work of [Donald Schön](https://hci.stanford.edu/publications/bds/9-schon.html) and his understanding of design as a *reflective conversation with materials*.

> As you work a problem, you are continually in the process of developing a path into it, forming new appreciations and understandings as you make new moves.

### Process Documentation Structure

Profile the website thing itself - the picture, the game itself, the idea of a public facing representation and then finer and finer details (Matt's thing)

### Why?

The point of this - the idea of continually pushing yourself to have a high level understanding of the meaning of your work (research-creation specific)

Show them, show that they are in a chronology

### Journal

Show some examples,

- a history of work,
- the potential for multi-media,
- the role of emotion,
- the swearing, the goings-wrong (crucial)

Again making sure that these lead us to commits/prototypes that are then reflective in some way of that moment in design history. Which is always, but bonus points if it really lands...

### ✨ Commits ✨

This is a potential big moment if we reveal *here specifically* that this is the kind of engine of amazement of MDM in general? The other stuff *could* be done just as you go along... and that feeds well into the next segment... I think that works pretty well. In which case I should probably *not* explain version control until here.

This is the moment where we understand version control at least a little bit. (It could be semi-hilarious to make a change to the talk and show its representation in the history of the project at some point)

But also to show

- Technical practice, conversation with materials
- Design taking place at the very lowest levels, decisions being made, attempts being made, design space being explored in a not-totally-linear way
- Emotion is probably in here too
- And maybe other stuff (the smart thing is to identify *n* commits that show off different ideas, but that also lead us to specific prototypes worth seeing)

## Prototypes

(At the heart of game design is *prototyping*, and version control allows us to see them all.)

And so this is where we need to

- Create branches to commits that allow me to show different webgl builds (or in engine, but I feel like that's trouble, so I just might want to be selective about the commits, pre-plan them)
- Show the game in engine at the end but also at some other stage of production - that different between seeing the game as a player and being able to see it, quite literally, from the positionality of the design... (is there some really fucking weird sense in which you can become a closer and closer version of the designer themselves? Body Snatcher?)

This bit should be kind of fun as well because I think the idea would be to return to moments I spoke about in the journal/why/commits section and show how we can see and be the design at that moment in time... unimaginably powerful...

## and Other Traces

This is where we're going to profile

- Other data like to-dos, curation/specialized documents, code,
- Canned Meta-data like GitHub visualizations:
  - <https://github.com/pippinbarr/v-r-5/pulse>
  - Can go through them but I think the must "interesting" thing here is how inferior they are to Ponte
- Ponte, the idea of time-as-life, rhythms, funny beats and breaks, ...
- This talk is [in the project repository as well](https://github.com/pippinbarr/v-r-5/blob/main/process/talks/talk.md)! It has its own [commit history](https://github.com/pippinbarr/v-r-5/commits/main/process/talks/talk.md)!

## of Design

- And so the point being that we have all these lenses on design we didn't have
- Becoming the designer
- Life and emotion
- Time-sliced
- Conversation with materials (at least for me)
- How design *really happens*, rather than the idealized view of design documents and final releases
