# List of Works

I want to sort of half-taxonomize and half-just-do-whatever-I-want to come up with ideas for what will appear on the island. Clear divisions between:

- Interiors (may include holes in walls though)
- Exterior installations
- Interactive elements

## Meta-notes

- In listing things I'm finding it's a lot of rooms and not so many exterior places? At a certain point that might start to feel a bit weird. It would be nice to see ways to balance it, but it's also true that "controlled environment" usually means a room, esp. because we can block out the directional light (mostly?).

## List of 26 September 2023

### Gaps / Passing through

i.e. the idea of light passing through a defined gap/window to illuminate what is on the other side but also to create defined shadows in the negative space.

1. Mind the Gaps **Exterior**
    - A series of vertical structures with decreasing space between them to the point where light no longer passes through and the shadow takes over.
2. A Windowed Room **Interior**
    - A room with one or more windows

### Basic Shadowplay

i.e. Just a causing an object to cast a shadow. What counts as basic though?

1. Cube and Point Light **Interior**
    - A room with a single cube and a single point light casting a shadow (soft)
2. Shape and Spotlight **Interior**
    - A room with a single shape and a single spotlight casting a shadow
3. Shape and directional light **Interior**
    - I like the idea of completing this set with a window that casts the directional light into the room that then casts a shadow from an object in the room (need to line that up properly)

### Hard and Soft and None

i.e. Demonstrating the difference between hard shadows, soft shadows, and no shadows. How to do this? A single room? What about interference between the lights? Maybe that's nice? Note the difference between casting and receiving too... separate concern?

1. Hard and Soft and None **Interior**
    - First approximation is just three lights (spots? points?) with each of the qualities maybe aimed at different objects but inevitably causing shadows on the others? Or I suppose spots would be able to completely separate which might be nice.

### Casting and Receiving

i.e. The difference between whether an object casts shadows or not and whether an object receives shadows or not.

1. Reception **Interior**
    - Two objects with one light, one of the objects does not receive shadows and the other does. Or three objects to include the cast of receives but doesn't cast. It's kind of oddly complex. Might need separate kind of combinatorial examples?

### Multiple Sources

i.e. The idea of multiple lights and therefore multiple shadows

1. From All Sides **Interior**
    - Maybe the idea of a single object with N point/spot lights around it causing it to cast shadows in multiple directions.

### Bias / Acne

i.e. The idea of playing with the bias settings in a controlled environment (maybe an elongated room for a bunch of examples) including shadow acne being induced through low bias.

1. Acne **Interior**
    - Maybe an acne room all on its own?
2. Bias **Interior**
    - Maybe a long room where a series of lights cast shadows at different bias values on individual objects.

### The Shape of You

i.e. The shadow cast by the player, some opportunity to switch it somewhere? Another interactive dias? Or a room where your shadow changes when you go in?

1. The Shape of You **Interior**
    - If a room, then one where in different areas your controller's mesh/geometry switches around to cast different shadows or no shadows at all. Ideally capsule, the other basic primitives, and maybe one or more fun meshes?
2. The Shape of You **Exterior**
    - If an exterior thing, then maybe a dias where if you stand on it you switch shadows to a random new shadow. Less controlled and maybe less legible? But would allow you to experience new shadows longer term in a variety of environments. Maybe different diases where you can "collect" different shadows?

### Accumulations

i.e. the idea of just having one or more installations outside that involve multiple shadows combinining in fun ways? Archways? Lattices? More organic shapes?

### Motion / Animation

i.e. the idea of a moving light source (again probably interior) or a moving object. Lots of potential motions here including orbits or linear motion or weirder motion. But also the question of scale of object, rotation, and also area of effect of the light.

### Color

i.e. Changing colors of light presumably changes the color of the shadows?

### On and off

i.e. the idea of a light source (or object?) turning on and off, so there are shadows and then no shadows or different shadows. No need to go quickly and give anyone a seizure though. Maybe a small sound effect (a click) to indicate it happening? If lights go on and off should connect this to the physical instantiation of the light (switch materials I suppose? Or switch of emission? Or something.)

### Quality

i.e. the ... wait can you do this per light? Yes. So lights with the different levels of shadow quality.

### Cookies

i.e. Lights can take cookies and it might be interesting to create a specific shadow cookie (how to represent that on the physical light if at all?)

### Strength

i.e. Lights can cast shadows at different strengths.  So create a room with lights that accomplish that. Spots are going to be the main kind of light for these demos I kind of feel?

### Realtime shadow color

This is an environment setting on the Lighting panel and I'm not sure if it can be changes.

### Dynamics

Oh god, what about dynamically changing properties (like bias) rather than demonstrating separate things? Or both conceivably? Starting to feel like a shitload of rooms.

### Outdoor Lights

Some variety of maybe toggling lights outside - a huge spot that illuminates the world, a point light in the context of the outside, etc.

### The sun

Some ways of seeing the impact of the sun on the world. Most obviously its rotation through a day/night cycle, but also other thoughts like colour, brightness, etc. that should be changeable (again have to think about permanent changes versus "while you're on the dias" changes)
