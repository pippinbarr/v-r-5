# In Praise of Shadows: Reflections, Prototypes, and Other Traces of Design

![](https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-5/press/images/cookie-interior.png)

## Introduction

### Hi, I'm [Pippin Barr](https://pippinbarr.com), an experimental game designer and a professor of Computation Arts at Concordia University

### I'm part of the [Games as Research](https://gamesasresearch.com) project to figure out how to document the game design process

### So I'm going to talk about the [Method for Design Materialization (MDM)](https://direct.mit.edu/desi/article-abstract/39/1/55/114217/Generative-Logics-and-Conceptual-Clicks-A-Case?redirectedFrom=fulltext), which is our current best idea

### And I'll use my newest game [*v r 5*](https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-5/info) to show you how it all works

## In Praise of Shadows

(Is [a book by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Praise_of_Shadows).)

## Reflections

(We draw heavily on the work of [Donald Schön](https://hci.stanford.edu/publications/bds/9-schon.html) and his understanding of design as a *reflective conversation with materials*.)

## Prototypes

(At the heart of game design is *prototyping*, and version control allows us to see them all.)

## and Other Traces
