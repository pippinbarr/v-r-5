# To-do

## Structures

- Build a few outdoor structures without thinking too hard about it just to populate the landscape a bit in a concentrated area
- Make a new shadow room that doesn't have insanely bad-looking seams (somehow)
- Practice embedding a building into the landscape a little more so it's easy to enter (beware of this a bit though because it will involve terraforming and then I'll have to rebumpify the landscape?)

## Terrain

- Experiment with holes (caves? inset buildings?)

## Interactions

- Create a platform that moves the sun while you stand on it (test whether we have the sun "snap back" to the eternal time of the island, or have it stay where you set it)
