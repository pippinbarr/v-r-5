## Introduction

Hi, I'm [Pippin Barr](https://pippinbarr.com), an experimental game designer and a professor of Computation Arts at Concordia University.

I'm part of the [Games as Research](https://gamesasresearch.com) project to figure out how to document the game design process.

So I'm going to talk about the [Method for Design Materialization (MDM)](https://direct.mit.edu/desi/article-abstract/39/1/55/114217/Generative-Logics-and-Conceptual-Clicks-A-Case?redirectedFrom=fulltext), which is our current best idea.

And I'll use my newest game [*v r 5*](https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-5/info) to show you how it all works.

(You're in its documentation right now!)

## In Praise of Shadows

*v r 5* was inspired by the book [In Praise of Shadows by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Praise_of_Shadows). Especially Tanizaki's writing about [the nuances and categories of shadows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Praise_of_Shadows?useskin=vector#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20contrasting%20light%20and%20dark%2C%20Tanizaki%20further%20considers%20the%20layered%20tones%20of%20various%20kinds%20of%20shadows%20and%20their%20power%20to%20reflect%20low%20sheen%20materials%20like%20gold%20embroidery%2C%20patina%20and%20cloudy%20crystals.%20In%20addition%2C%20he%20distinguishes%20between%20the%20values%20of%20gleam%20and%20shine.).

The *v r* series in general is part of my (long) history of making work that surfaces the technical underpinnings of games, such as [*v r 1*](https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-1/info/) (about architecture), [*v r 2*](https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-2/info/) (about Unity Game Objects), [*v r 3*](https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-3/info/) (about water), and [*v r $4.99*(https://pippinbarr.com/v-r-4-99/info/)] (about the Asset Store).

And so I continued with a plan to examine [*shadows* in the Unity game engine](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Shadows.html), and to make them available for contemplation.

## Reflections

Within MDM draw heavily on the work of [Donald Schön](https://hci.stanford.edu/publications/bds/9-schon.html) and his understanding of design as a *reflective conversation with materials*.

## Prototypes

(At the heart of game design is *prototyping*, and version control allows us to see them all.)
