## Description

*Shadows! Flickering shadows! With hard edges! Or soft! Baked or realtime! Moving with the sun! Growing in intensity! Gold gleaming in their darkness!*

*v r 5* is an "art island" where you can explore the Unity game engine's implementation of shadows. In a series of 26 rooms, 11 sculptures, and 3 interactive platforms the island shows you the different ways shadows can appear, from the naturalistic to the janky, from making a gold vase gleam in darkness to disappearing altogether.

*v r 5* was created in [Unity](https://unity.com/) (2022.3.7f1). The island topography and textures are derived from an island in [Free Island Collection](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/free-island-collection-104753). The water is the (discontinued!) ProWater from Unity's old Standard Assets. The character controller in the game is [Gold Player](https://github.com/Hertzole/gold-player) by hertzole.
