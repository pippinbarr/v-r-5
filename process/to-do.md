# To-do

## Meta

- Build a list of hypothesized rooms and sculptures/installations (maybe in a separate file to track which ones I make/don't make, etc.)

## Structures

- ~~Make a new shadow room that doesn't have insanely bad-looking seams (somehow)~~

- Build a few outdoor structures without thinking too hard about it just to populate the landscape a bit in a concentrated area
- Practice embedding a building into the landscape a little more so it's easy to enter (beware of this a bit though because it will involve terraforming and then I'll have to rebumpify the landscape?)

## Terrain

- Experiment with holes (caves? inset buildings?)

## Interactions

- Create a platform that moves the sun while you stand on it (test whether we have the sun "snap back" to the eternal time of the island, or have it stay where you set it)
- Create triggers to turn any lights inside a space on or off (based on an array? Or the script could search the parenting of the room maybe.)
